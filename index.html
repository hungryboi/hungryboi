<h1>How to Awesome: Barney Stinson</h1>
    <p class = "Awesomeness">Awesomeness orginated from George Washington's long lost brother; Sir Awesome Washington I.

     A prime example of awesomeness, is the image below. A show that aired from 2006 to 2014 named How I Met Your Mother contained of the most awesome character in all of television existence: Barney Stinson. Infamous for his playboy skills, Barney Stinson, played by Neil Patrick Harris, was truly and utterly awesome. Not only that, he was rich, making him the most awesome person ever.
